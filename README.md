# 581_helpmate

Helpmate is a web application designed to help students keep track of events from multiple categories of life (academics, social, health, travel). It utilizes the reactjs as a frontend framework, expressjs as middlware, and nodejs, and mysql database to process data and requests on the backend. Early prototypes for the project were designed in Figma.

The project was conceptualized and designed by Alice Kuang and developed over the course of a year with her teammates: Minh Huyen Nguyen, Eva Morrison, Brooke Jackson, and Minh Thong Pham.
